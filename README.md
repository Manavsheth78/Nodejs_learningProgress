## 📂 Repo Structure
- `/PiyushGarg_playlist` – code written while following the Node.js YouTube playlist from piyush grag !
- `/projects` – mini projects I build to apply concepts (CLI apps, REST APIs, etc.)
- `/progress` – weekly progress charts (visualizing actual vs expected)

---

## ✅ Current Status
- Reached **Video 13** of the Node.js playlist
- Started building my first REST API (users CRUD, error handling)

---

## 🛠 Mini Projects (so far)
- **Notes CLI** → add/list/remove notes stored in JSON  
- **Simple REST API** → basic CRUD endpoints for users  

Next up:  
- [ ] JWT authentication with Postgres  
- [ ] MIDDLEWARE
- [ ] SSR
- [ ] FILE UPLOAD
- [ ] COOKIES
